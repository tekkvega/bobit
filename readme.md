# Bobit

just a little discord bot i made with serenity

## How do I use it?

download the the latest artifact file in the **Actions** tab of Github, then create a new file named **bot.json** it and use this format
```{
  "token": (bot token here in ""),
  "prefix": (your choice of the prefix also in "")
  }```
then simply just run the bot and ill work, the prefix is `&` if you wanna change it just compile the code yourself with your own prefix
