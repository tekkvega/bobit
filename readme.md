# Bobit

just a little discord bot i made with serenity

## How do I use it?

download the the latest artifact file in the **Actions** tab of Github, then create a new file named **.env** it put ```DISCORD_TOKEN=(your bot token here)``` in the file, then simply just run the bot and ill work, the prefix is `&` if you wanna change it just compile the code yourself with your own prefix
