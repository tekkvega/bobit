# Bobit

just a little discord bot i made with serenity

## How do I use it?

download the the latest artifact file in [**Actions**](https://github.com/tekkvega/bobit/actions), unzip it and create a new file named **bot.json** it and use this format
```
{
  "token": (bot token here in ""),
  "prefix": (your choice of the prefix also in "")
}
  ```

then simply just run the bot
